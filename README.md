About Me

I’m Saurabh Kumar Mishra, a backend-focused full-stack developer currently working as a Senior Software Developer at Techfield Solution and the Co-Founder of SemesterExam.com.

I focus on building production-grade software systems with real ownership. My work involves backend architecture, database design, API development, and full-stack integration. I don’t just build features — I build systems that are meant to scale and last.

My strongest area is backend engineering and databases, particularly MongoDB, where I work on schema design, query optimization, and performance-driven data modeling.

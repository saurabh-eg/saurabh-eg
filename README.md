 👋 About Me

I’m Saurabh Kumar Mishra, a backend-heavy full-stack developer and **Co-Founder of SemesterExam.com and Techfield Solution**.

I focus on building real, production-level systems — not just writing code, but owning the architecture, database design, APIs, and integrations that keep products running reliably at scale.

My strongest area is backend engineering and databases, especially MongoDB.  
I believe the backend and database are the backbone of any serious application, and I design them with long-term scalability in mind.

- Backend Development (Node.js, Express)
- Database Design & Optimization (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL)
- API Architecture & System Integration
- Full-Stack Web Development (React, Next.js)
- Mobile Development (React Native)
- Problem Solving & DSA (Java)
- Cloud Computing Fundamentals
